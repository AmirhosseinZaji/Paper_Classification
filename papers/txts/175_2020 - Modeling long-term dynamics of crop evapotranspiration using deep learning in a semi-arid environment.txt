Thus, precise estimation of ET cis valuable for various applications of agricultural water engineering,especially in developing countries such as Egypt, which has lack of meteorological data, high cost and time tocalculate ET c, and lack of information on future ET cvalues to consider management scenarios and increaseproductionpotential.Also,duetotheexistenceofdifferentclimatesinEgypt,theestimateofET chasbecomeachallenge.Tothisend,theaimofthisstudywastoestimatetheET ctoeliminatethelimitationsmentioned,andanalyze the long-term dynamics of ET cbased on limited climate data and simple method. Three EgyptiangovernoratesnamelyAdDaqahliyah,AshSharqiyah,andKafrashShaykhofNileDelta,wereselectedasmajorwheat-producing sites. The required historical required climatic data were collected from open access datalibrarywhilefuturedatawerefromtwoextremescenariosoftheRepresentativeConcentrationPathways(RCP)i.e.,RCP4.5,andRCP8.5.Theavailabledatasetwasdividedintothreeparts:(i)calibrationfrom1970−2000,(ii) validation from 2000−2017, and (iii) prediction from 2022−2035. The deep neural network (DNN) wasemployed for incorporating historical data and predicting future ETc. For the evaluation of generated DNNmodels,theresearchfindingindicatesthatthecorrelationcoefficientsbetweenactualversuspredictedmonthlyETcwere found to be 0.95, 0.96, and 0.97 for calibration period, and 0.94, 0.95 and 0.95 for validation at AdDaqahliyah,KafrashShaykh,andAshSharqiyahregions,respectively.Forthesimulationoffutureclimaticdata,maximumtemperature(T max)willincreasedby5.19%,4.22%,and20.82%,minimumtemperature(T min)willincreased by 1.62 %, 36.44 %, and 27.80 %, and solar radiation (SR) will increased by 6.53 %, 18.74 %, and28.83%forthestudylocations,respectively.Moreover,theDNNmodelexposedthattheKafrashShaykhattainthe highest values of ET cwith an increase of 11.31 %, slightly increased of 1.38 for Ad Daqahliyah, anddecreasedby15.09%forAshSharqiyahincomparisontothehistoricaldata.Thus,theproposedmodelofcropwater-use prediction effectively estimated ET cof wheat and make an efficient decision. The developed modelsproduced satisfactory results for water managers to save water and achieve the sustainability of agriculturalwater.1. IntroductionAgricultural water resources in the context of changing climateconditions are decreasing in different regions of worldwide with moreemphasis in the semi-arid and arid zones. Therefore, accurate evalua-tion of irrigation water needs for crops is an urgent to increase theproductivityandefficiencyofirrigationwater-use(Fargetal.,2012).Inaddition, crop evapotranspiration (ET c) estimates are needed to assesstheir temporal variability and long-term trends with climate feedbackmechanisms (Feng et al., 2017) and reduce the negative effects of ex-cess irrigation water on crop production (Pôças et al., 2015). Evapo-transpirationistheintegrationoftwosectionsnamelyevaporationandtranspiration that defined as the lost water from the soil surface andcrop, respectively (Jensen and Allen, 2016). Several mathematicalmodels used to determine the reference evapotranspiration (ETo).However, the method of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106334Received 22 March 2020; Received in revised form 10 June 2020; Accepted 12 June 2020⁎Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: ahmed_elbeltagi@zju.edu.cn, ahmedelbeltagy81@mans.edu.eg (A.

All rights reserved.TFAO-56 Penman Monteith (Allen et al., 1998) is the most superiorcomparing to other (Gavila et al., 2007; Pereira et al., 2014; Tabariet al., 2013). But, it needs many climate data factors (Hobbins, 2016;Maroufpoor et al., 2020). Although ETocan be estimated by thismethodmostaccurately,largescalemeteorologicaldatarequirementatspecific spatiotemporal scales (maximum and minimum air tempera-tures,windspeed,solarradiation,andvaporpressuredeficit)arequiteoftennotavailableinmanydevelopingcountries(Almoroxetal.,2015;Dadaser-celik et al., 2016; Espadafor et al., 2011; Irmak et al., 2012).Therefore,thealternatemodelsarerequiredforestimationofETowhenthe available data are either limited or insufficient. So, this study usesonly temperature and solar radiation data as inputs to the alternativemodel.The literature survey depicts that previously, several research stu-dies have been focused on ET oestimation using remote sensing (Fargetal.,2012),AquaCropmodel(Butleretal.,2017; Lietal.,2016),FAO-CROPWAT (Surendran et al., 2015). However, the soft computing ap-plications and analysis of big data techniques for actual evapo-transpirationmodelingarerestrictiveinthepreviousreviewliterature.Numerous soft computing approaches have been widely applied toachieve the tractability, robustness, and provide low-cost solutionwith tolerance of imprecision, partial truth, uncertainty, and an ap-proximation (Khoshravesh et al., 2017; Mehdizadeh et al., 2017;Motamedi et al., 2015). In agriculture field, analyzing big data haveofferednewlypredictivemodelsforEToestimation,forexample,fuzzy-genetic and regularization random forest (Saggi and Jain, 2019a),firefly algorithm (Motamedi et al., 2015), adaptive neuro-fuzzy meth-odology(Gocicetal.,2015),convolutionneuralnetwork(CNN)(Chenet al., 2020), hybrid models which use techniques such as data fusionandensemblemodeling,datadecompositionaswellasremotesensing-basedhybridization(Chiaetal.,2020),data-drivenmodels(Kisietal.,2015;Malik et al., 2019), wavelet conjunction heuristic (Kisi andAlizamir, 2018), artificial and wavelet neural networks (WNNs) basedon temperature and wind speed data (Falamarzi et al., 2014), combi-nation of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and GeneExpressionProgramming(GEP)modelswithautoregressiveconditionalheteroscedasticity (ARCH) time series model (Mehdizadeh, 2018),support vector regression coupled with nature-inspired algorithm(MohammadiandMehdizadeh,2020; Tikhamarineetal.,2020, 2019),random forest and gene expression programming (Wang et al., 2019).The aforementioned methods produced satisfactory outcomes for esti-mationofevapotranspirationthantheempiricalmodels.Therefore,itissubstantial to understand the temporal distributions of evapo-transpiration and its projected changes using limited meteorologicaldataandsimplemethod.Theproposedworkcontributebasicguidanceto water-users and agricultural development planners for better asses-sing of ETc, in the light of climate data availability, for the proper es-timation of crop water demands.To project the future changes in crop actual evapotranspiration,little researches have been conducted e.g., Xiao et al. (2018) usedAgricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model and foundthat ET cdecreased across all stations under the two future climatescenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5)., Mehdi and Vienna (2010) simulatedthe daily and the season total crop requirements using CROPWATmodelandfoundadecreaseof2.71%(8mm),21%(64mm)and6%(59 mm) using the Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) with Cana-dian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CGCM1), and UKHadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research (HADCM3) usingemission scenarios A2 and B2 predictors, respectively for the 2050scomparing with CROPWAT Model., Jeong et al. (2010) simulated ET cbasedonartificialneuralnetwork(ANN)andHadCM3,andtheyfoundthat the increasing ETcgradually to 2099. Moreover, the agriculturalwater demand model was applied by Aladenola and Madramootoo(2010), and their findings showed that the percentage difference be-tweenfutureandcurrentirrigationwaterneedsrangedfrom-2 to2%.Furthermore, SDSM was used by Li et al. (2012), and they found theprojectedincrease of4% fortheperiod 2011–2040. Chenetal.(2019)simulated the impacts of climate change on hydrology and crop pro-duction using an improved Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)model.TheirresultsstatedthatannualET candirrigationdecreasedby8%–25 and 15 %–42 %, respectively, under the climate changescenarioscomparedtothehistoricalperiod.Thesemodelsrequiremanyclimatic data and geographical information for the prediction of ETcprocess.Inthisstudy,deepneuralnetwork(DNN)wasappliedbasedonleast climatic data, three climatic factors only for ETcprediction inthree governorates of Nile Delta region.Themostnecessaryissuetoknowaboutthedeeplearningapproachisthatthenewfeaturesarelearnedandtransformedthroughthesedeepneural architectures to increase the efficiency of the overall learning.DL can be used to model the complex relationship between input andoutputbecauseofitshighhierarchicalstructuremodelfeaturelearning,construction, and training (Saggi and Jain, 2019b; Wang et al., 2018).The DNN method has been used in the agricultural and hydrologicalfields due to the difficulty of software data availability, costs andcomplexity, e.g., estimation and modeling of crop reference evapo-transpiration(Ferreira and França, 2020; Saggi and Jain, 2019b), cropdisease characterization (Lee et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2018), fast im-plementationofreal-timedetection(KangandChen,2020; Zhangetal.,2019), automatic extraction of agricultural regulations (Espejo-Garciaetal.,2019),cropdiseaseclassification(Piconetal.,2018; Thenmozhiand Reddy, 2019), robotic precisionfarming (Kounalakis et al., 2019),automated training of trees on trellis wires (Majeed et al., 2020), hy-droponics system (Mehra et al., 2018), flood prediction (Vinayaka andSuzanna, 2020), groundwater estimation from major physical hy-drology components (Hassan et al., 2020), and runoff simulation (Fanet al., 2020).Wheatasanimportantfoodsecuritycropwasselectedinthisstudy.It is the major winter cereal grain crop and the third major crop intermsofareaplantedinEgypt(FAO,2011),accountingfor43%ofthetotalwintercroparea(Sayedetal.,2019).Inaddition,thereisalargegap between its production and consumption (Abdelmageed et al.,2019).Furthermore,toourknowledge,therearenostudiesavailableintheliteraturethatevaluatetheETcofwheatatthepresentandfutureinthe semi-arid regions using deep learning. Hence, the aim of this re-search is (i) to analyze the temporal distributions of ETcfrom 1970 to2017,and(ii)toprojectthefuturechangesinET cfrom2022to2035byemploying the DNN method. This information is commanding to learnthe impact of climate change on ET cin the study region.2. Materials and methods2.1. Study areaThestudyareaislocatedontheNileDeltainEgypt.Itoccupiesthenorthern part of Egypt where the Nile meets the Mediterranean Sea.The total length of the Nile River is approximately 7000 km, and it isknown as the longest river in the world. The Nile Delta accounts forapproximately2%ofthetotalareaofEgyptandcontainsupto63%ofthe agricultural land. The delta starts approximately 20 km north ofCairo and continues north for 150 km. The width of the delta is ap-proximately250kmandisboundedAlexandriagovernorateinthewestand Port Said in the east. The annual mean maximum air temperature(Tmax)is24 ℃,andtheannualmeanminimumairtemperature(T min)is16℃. The wind speed (WS) varies from 3.8 to 5.2 ms−1, and therainfall season starts in October, representing approximately 75 ofthetotalrainfall.MostoftherainfallsoccurinDecemberandJanuary,which are known as therainiest months in this region (Shalaby, 2012;ShalabyandTateishi,2007).WeselectedthreegovernoratesintheNileDelta, namely, Ad Daqahliyah, Ash Sharqiyah, and Kafr ash Shaykhwith total area of 11088 km2, as shown in Fig. 1. Wheat crop wasselected for this study as one of the most important grain crops grownprincipally during the winter season in Egypt. The local production isA. Elbeltagi, et al. Agricultural Water Management 241 (2020) 1063342notsufficienttosupplytheannualdemandoftheincreasingpopulation(Abdelmageedetal.,2019).Hence,increasingwheatproductionisthemost important possibility for reducing the wheat gap and reach self-sufficiency of wheat production. We have collected the total agri-cultural crop-land areas of wheat for the three governorates fromagriculturedirectoratesofgovernoratesandcalculatedthecoverageofwheatcropintheseregions.Wefoundthatwheatcropcovers35.72%,28.69 %, 39.71 in the studied regions. According to the Food andAgricultural Organization (FAO) guidelines, the months for plantingand harvesting wheat are from November to April. The length of cropgrowthstagesare40,60,60,and40daysforinitial,development,mid,and late periods, respectively (FAO, 2000).2.2. Data sourcesFor historical data, the monthly data of maximum temperature(Tmax), minimum temperature (T min), precipitation (P), and solar ra-diation (SR) from November to April for wheat were extracted fromopen access data using Environmental Systems Research Institute(ESRI) Arc GIS tool over the period from 1970 to 2017 with spatialresolution of about km2. For more details about open access data,average maximum and minimum temperatures data were collectedfrom Climatic Research Unit Ts 4.0 as Network Common Data Form(NetCDF) format at 0.5° grid for the global land surface (Abatzoglouetal.,2018).Furthermore,solarradiationdatawerecollectedfromtheJapanese 55-year Reanalysis JRA-55 as NetCDF format (Kobayashiet al., 2015).For future climate data projection, General Circulation Models(GCMs) are physical-based tools that provide reasonable basis fordeterminingfutureclimatedata.However,thegenerateddatafromthattool cannot be used directly in several regions or agricultural, waterresources, and environmental researches due to poor simulation oflocal-scaleprocesses(Masudetal.,2018).Thus,itisnecessarytomakedownscaling of GCM output data before application in the impact stu-dies, e.g., calibration of the DNN model. Three GCMs were obtainedfrom the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment(CORDEX) initiative. This platform was developed by the World Cli-mate Research Program (WCRP) to generate High-Resolution ClimateDatasets (HRCD) over many locations worldwide (Gutowski et al.,2016). The Tmax, Tmin, and SR datawere obtained as monthly datasetsfrom the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) over the period from2022to2035.TheESGFportalallowsusertodiscoverdata,andcreatescriptstofetchthedata.Also,thissystemprovidesthefulldetailsaboutthe selected variable and it’s available as NetCDF format. The processfor transferring data set is for one variable for all realizations of onemodel for one experiment. Two Global Climate Models (GCMs): IPSL-CM5ALR (Institute Pierre-Simon Laplace) and MPI-ESM-MR (MaxPlanck Institute for Meteorology) were used as projections of climatechange within the Coupled Model Inter comparison Project (Tayloretal.,2012).Besides,theRegionalClimateModel(RCM)usedwasDMIHIRHAM5anditsdrivingGCMwasICHEC-EC-EARTH(Luhungaetal.,2018). Two extreme scenarios of the Representative ConcentrationPathways,i.e.,RCP4.5,andRCP8.5wereusedasclimateprojections.CORDEX-RCMsimulationsfortheAfricandomain(AFR−CORDEX)areconducted at two different spatial resolutions, the general CORDEXresolution of 0.44 degree (AFR-44, ∼50 km).2.3. Calculation of crop evapotranspirationTo calculate reference evapotranspiration ETo, the HargreavesFig. 1.Location map of study area.A. Elbeltagi, et al. Agricultural Water Management 241 (2020) 1063343method (HM) suggested by Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)was used as illustrated in Eq. (1). This method was used because theparameters necessary to calculate the Penman-Monteith (PM) modelare not available (Hargreaves and Allen, 2003; Aguilar et al., 2011;FooladmandandZandilak,2008; Pateletal.,2014; RazieiandPereira,2013). The advantage of the HM over PM is that it only requiresminimumandmaximumtemperatures,andsolarradiationdata,whichmay be easily obtained from available GIS-raster data.= + ET 0.0023 (T 17.8)(T )o mean max min0.5(1)Where: meanis the average temperature (oC), Tmaxis the maximumtemperature (oC), Tminis the minimum temperature (oC) and ais ex-traterrestrial radiation (mm/ month).We then determined the crop coefficient using the thermal unitaccordingtoEq.(2)by(Sammisetal.,1985).Theequationestablishedwas equivalent to 0.12 for value through the growing season, parti-cularly for maize crop. But in this study, values of were modified tomatch the wheat crop. values were 0.05 for early-stage, 0.5 for thestem extension stage, 0.63 for the heading stage and -0.38 for the latestage.

Temporal analysis of crop evapotranspirationOpenGeoDaisasoftwarepackagepreparedtoproducespatialdataanalysis, is an open- source successor to GeoDa. GeoDa was designedunder the auspices of the National Science Foundation (NSF) fundedCenter for Spatially Integrated Social Science (Anselin et al., 2006). Itwas used to interpret the spatial distribution of ETcfor the long term.The collected data of minimum and maximum temperatures and solarradiation during 1970–2017 are interpolated to show the present spa-tial-temporal changes for the three studied locations.2.5. Projection of crop evapotranspirationHistorical data were divided into two segments as input variablesfortheartificialintelligencemodel,from1970to2000forthetrainingand2001–2017forthevalidating.TheDeepneuralnetwork(DNN)wasappliedusingVisualGeneDeveloper(VGD)softwareversion1.9(Jungand Mcdonald, 2011), as shown in the interface (Fig. 2). The DNN isdesignedfrommanytypesoflayers:(1)theinputlayeristheinitialdatafor DNN, (2) the hidden layers are intermediate layers between theindependent input and dependent output layers where all the compu-tations are done, and (3) the output layer produces the result for thegiven inputs (Elbeltagi et al., 2020a). The software not only providesgeneral functions for gene analysis and optimization along with an in-teractiveuser-friendlyinterface,butalsoincludesuniquefeaturessuchas programming capability, dedicated mRNA secondary structure pre-diction, artificial neural network modeling, network multi-threadedcomputing, and user-accessible programming modules. The softwareallows user to analyze and optimize sequence using main menufunctions or specialized module windows. Alternatively, geneoptimization can be initiated by designing gene construct and con-figuringanoptimizationstrategy.Ausercanchooseseveralpredefinedor user-defined algorithms to design complicated strategy.

Thismethodwascalibratedatthreehiddenlayers(10nodes/layer),learningrate(0.003),momentumcoefficient(0.1),transferfunction(Hyperbolictangent),targeterror(0.00001),initializationmethodofthresholdandweight factor (Random), and analysis update interval (500 iterations).There are five type of transfer functions including Sigmoid, Tangent,Hyperbolic tangent, Gaussian, and Linear. In the present study, theHyperbolictangentfunctionandothermodelparameterswereselectedbased onthelowest RMSE, which is acommonprocedure inliterature(Maroufpoor et al., 2019a, 2019b). Finally future data from 2022 to2035 were added in the prediction set to simulate future crop evapo-transpirationundertheimpactsofthetwo-climatechangescenarios.Alayout of the adopted methodology is shown in Fig. 3.2.6. Performance evaluationTheactualandpredictedETcvalueswerecomparedthroughoutthestudy period. To evaluate the performance of the DNN model, the fol-lowing statistical indicators were selected: mean square error (MSE),root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), meanabsolute relative error (MARE), mean absolute percentage error(MAPE), Accuracy (Acc), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) (Elbeltagietal.,2020a; SaggiandJain,2019b; YamaçandTodorovic,2020; Taoetal.,2015; Seyedzadehetal.,2019).Alltheseindicatorsaredefinedasfollows:1 Mean square error (MSE)==ETc ET MSE1N( )iNActiPi12(4)2 Root mean square error (RMSE)==ETc ETc RMSE1N( )iNActiPi12(5)3 Mean absolute error (MAE)==ETc ETc MAE1N|( )|iNActiPi1(6)4 Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)= ×=ETc ETcETcMAPE 1001N|( )|iNActiPiActi 1(7)5 Mean absolute relative error (MARE)==ETc ETcETcMARE|( )|iNActiPiActi 1(8)6 Accuracy (Acc)=ETc ETcETcAcc abs (mean )PiActiActi(9)7 Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE)==ETc ETcETc ETcNSE 1( )( )iNActiPiActi 122(10)WhereETcAi istheactualorobservedvalue,ETcPi isthepredictedvalue,ETc isthemeanvalue,andNisthetotalnumberofdatapoints.A.

For the third governorate (Ash Sharqiyah), theyear of 2015 was the best for predicting the ET c(RMSE =4.71mm.month−1, MAE =4.11 mm.month−1, MARE =0.08 mm/month,MAPE 11.05 %, Acc 0.92, and NSE 0.93) as listed in Table 5.Also, the lowest accuracy and NSE were estimated in 2002 (NSE =0.76). As averages of the calibration and validation years, the re-lationship between the predicted versus actual wheat ETcproducedsatisfactory results. The coefficient of determination, slope, and inter-cept are 0.95, 0.91,and 9.27 for Ad Daqahliyah,0.96, 0.98, and -4.59for Kafr ash Shaykh, and 0.97, 0.94, and 9.73 for Ash Sharqiyah,respectively for the calibration period. Additionally, for the validationperiod, the corresponding values were 0.94, 0.80, and 12.55 in AdDaqahliyah, 0.95, 0.88, -1.74 in Kafr ash Shaykh, and 0.95, 0.82, and13.95 in Ash Sharqiyah, respectively.Fig. 7.Actual versus predicted monthly ET cin Ad Daqahliyah during calibra-tion and validation periods.Fig. 8.Actual versus predicted monthly ET cin Kafr ash Shaykh during cali-bration and validation periods.Table 3Comparison between the predicted and actual crop evapotranspiration over2000-2017 in Ad Daqahliyah.Years Actual Predicted MSE RMSE MAE MAPE MARE Acc NSE(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (%) (mm)2000 290.13 317.04 38.17 6.17 5.14 13.27 0.1 0.9 0.872001 294.67 310.81 57.78 7.6 6.64 14.77 0.13 0.87 0.842002 275.6 316.07 71.18 8.43 7.58 18.52 0.16 0.84 0.782003 265.96 300.15 35.89 5.99 5.69 13.97 0.12 0.88 0.782004 287.96 302.09 40.23 6.34 5.55 12.83 0.11 0.89 0.882005 283.96 305.66 28.28 5.14 11.98 0.1 0.9 0.92006 285.41 304.79 28.89 5.37 5.04 12.27 0.1 0.9 0.92007 277.56 300.53 21.52 4.64 4.02 11.33 0.08 0.92 0.922008 296.68 299.42 88.89 9.43 8.51 17.18 0.17 0.83 0.82009 292.41 312.68 18.65 4.31 3.41 8.73 0.07 0.93 0.922010 301.78 304 31.38 5.6 4.57 9.32 0.09 0.91 0.912011 285.59 317.01 46.01 6.78 5.23 11.82 0.11 0.89 0.792012 274.01 294.94 23.35 4.83 4.67 12.11 0.1 0.9 0.912013 295.84 303.68 46.7 6.83 5.69 11.35 0.11 0.89 0.882014 288.05 308.29 20.06 4.47 3.63 9.85 0.07 0.93 0.932015 277.03 290.32 10.31 3.21 2.98 7.86 0.06 0.94 0.962016 285.29 302.43 21.93 4.68 4.33 11.45 0.09 0.91 0.932017 275.77 303.21 29.13 5.39 4.67 13.28 0.1 0.9 0.9MSE: Mean squareerror, RMSE: Rootmean square error,MAE: Mean absoluteerror, MARE: Mean absolute relative error, MAPE: Mean absolute percentageerror, Acc: Accuracy, NSE: Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency.A. Elbeltagi, et al. Agricultural Water Management 241 (2020) 10633483.2. Projected changes in wheat evapotranspiration during 2022 2035The projected increase in climatic factors under the average twoscenarios is greater than the average of historical period from 1970 to2017. The increase in temperature was attributed to the increase ofTmaxdegrees from 22.29 °C to 25.43 °C, 22.11 °C–23.09 °C, and 22.69°C–28.66 °C, respectively for Ad Daqahliyah, Ash Sharqiyah, and KafrashShaykh.ThecorrespondingT mindegreesalsoincreasedfrom9.97°Cto 11.03 °C, from 9.37 °C to 14.75 °C and from 9.68 °C to 13.41 °C,respectively. For the three regions, SR values also increased from 6.43to7.45mm day−1,from 6.61to8.13mmday-1andfrom6.41to9.01mm day−1, respectively. maxwill increase by 5.19 %, 4.22 %, and20.82 for Ad Daqahliyah, Ash Sharqiyah, and Kafr ash Shaykh, re-spectively(Fig.9).Whereas,theircorrespondingaveragevaluesofT minwillincreaseby1.62%,36.44%,and27.80%,respectively.Thehighlyincrease in Tminand Tmaxdata affected directly on the expected solarradiation (SR) values as stated by Elbeltagi et al. (2020b). It wouldincrease by 6.53 %, 18.74 %, and 28.83 for the corresponding re-gions as mentioned above, respectively (Fig. 9).AfterthecalibrationandvalidationoftheDNNmodelbasedontheclimate data scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) during the historical periodsthat incorporated to the DNN method, the predicted wheat ET cfrom2022−2035 based on future data for the three studied regions as illu-strated inTable 6. The projected ET cvalues vary due to climate var-iations between max, Tmin, and SR in RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 withaverages of 1.22 ℃, 1.78 ℃, and 0.91 mm.day−1. The results showedthat Kafr ash Shaykh governorate produced the highest values of ET cduring the future period, which is averaged from 302.03 in 2024 to329.68 in 2032. The average value of ET cduring 1970–2017 and2022−2035was281.84mmand313.72mmwithanincreaseby11.31%(Fig. 10). Then, the Ad Daqahliyah was the second rank, which isranged from 262.98 in 2031 to 301.53 in 2026. The correspondingpercent increased of ETcis 1.38 compared to the historical data.

DiscussionCrop evapotranspiration values of wheat predicted based on thefollowed method in this study were compared to actual during cali-bration and validation periods as discussed earlier in section 3.1. FAOsuggested the Kc values for the initial, development, mid, and latestages of the crop are 0.7, 0.9, 1.15, and 0.25 (FAO, 2000). The cvaluesareappropriatewithFAOthroughthegrowingseasonare0.72,0.88, 1.13 and 0.32. These findings are similar to those of Farg et al.(2012),whoindicatedthatthedeterminationcoefficients(R2)betweencombination of Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and NormalizedDifference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as spectral vegetation indices forestimating cwere 0.827, 0.903, and 0.976 through initial, mid, andlastgrowthstages,respectively.In addition,thesefindingswerebetterthanPôças et al. (2015) who found that the R2between reflectance-based vegetation indices and soil water balance SIMDual model was0.72. Our results have achieved high performance compared to Anweret al. (2016), reported that the average relative error values betweenthe approximate values of Kcand FAO were 36.29 %. In addition, theresultsobtainedareinlinewith Elbeltagi etal.(2020b),whomodeledKcvalues using min, Tmax, and SR and produced satisfactory outputwith high accuracy and less statistical error. Moreover, our cresultsare good in comparison with Mulovhedzi et al. (2020), who estimatedKcvalues based on Growing Degree Days (GDD) only and found theequation was successfully validated by comparing measured againstestimated cwith an R2= 0.80 and mean absolute percent difference(MAPD)=7%.Inaddition,theseresultsimplythatthereferenceET cismore sensitive to min, Tmaxand SR, which consistent with the similarstudies conducted in West Texas (Awal et al., 2020), Kaduna CentralDistrict (Onwuegbunam et al., 2020), Pearl River Basin (Huang et al.,2020), and in the semi-arid region of South India (Gonzalez et al.,2020).Inaddition,thecurrentfollowedmethodforpredictionofwheatETcarecloseto Chenetal.(2020),whoappliedthetemporalconvolution-network model for predicting ET cand generated well output with R2rangedfrom0.91to0.95.Moreover,theresearchfindingsaresimilartothe outputs of fuzzy-genetic and regularization random forest modelspresented by Saggi and Jain (2019a), they found that the models hadhigh performance for modeling cand ET c(e.g. RMSE =0.1160−0.396, R2= 0.830−0.99, cc= 94 – 99 %). As well, ourfindings are in agreement with Yamaç and Todorovic (2020), theyemployedthedifferentmachinelearning(ML)modelsbasedonlimitedclimatedata,andresultsrevealsthesatisfactoryoutputsofMLwithR2rangedfrom0.81to0.97.Moreover,theresultsareinlinewith Evertonet al. (2020), evaluated the performance of the Simple Algorithm forEvapotranspiration Retrieving (SAFER) using missing meteorologicaldata.TheirfindingsstatedthatR2rangedfrom0.95to0.97atmissingany data of solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity. Ad-ditionally, the developed model produced satisfactory outputs com-paredtoMasellietal.(2020),usedanimprovednormalizeddifferencevegetation index (NDVI) based on Fractional Vegetation Cover andstated that R2increased from 0.814 to 0.933, while RMSE decreasedfrom 1.73 to 0.57 mm. Also, this study gave similar results withFalamarzi et al. (2014) outputs, they estimated ET based on tempera-ture and wind speed data using artificial and wavelet neural networks(WNNs)andfoundthebestmodelproducedhighNSE(0.79),R2(0.89),and low RMSE (1.03 mm/day). Furthermore, the DNN outputs agreewellwiththatof KisiandAlizamir(2018),appliedthewaveletextremelearning machine (WELM) model for modeling evapotranspiration andfound high R2as 0.97 and 0.96 for model during training and testingwiththecombinationofsolarradiation,meanairtemperature,relativehumidity,and windspeed. In addition, theresultsarein linewith Kisi(2016), who observed that the M5 model tree produced the best al-ternative with high correlation with Penman Monteith method for es-timating evapotranspiration in the absence of local input and outputdata. Besides, the generated DNN results are in agreement with thefindings of Khoshravesh et al. (2017), estimated monthly ET using themultivariate fractional polynomial, robust regression, and Bayesianregression models and concluded that all models provided closeragreement with the calculated values for FAO-PM (R2= 0.95 andRMSE 12.07 mm month−1).5.

Elbeltagi, et al. Agricultural Water Management 241 (2020) 10633410changesonwheatevapotranspiration(ET c)usingdeepneuralnetworks(DNN) method. Three Egyptian governorates were selected in NileDeltanamelyAdDaqahliyah,KafrashShaykh,andAshSharqiyah.Themonthly data of minimum temperature (T min), maximum temperature(Tmax), and solar radiation (SR) were obtained from open access dataover the period from 1970 to 2000 and from 2000−2017 for calibra-tion and validation. In addition, the climate weather data were col-lected from two Representative Concentration Pathways during2022−2035. After generating ET cby Hargreaves method with histor-icalandfutureweatherdata,thehistoricaldatawereenteredasinputsfor valuing the outputs of the generated DNN model. The resultsshowed high correlation between actual-predicted ETcvalues for ca-libration and validation periods over the three study regions. Aftergenerating good results from the DNN model through the historicalperiod, the future dataset was incorporated to predict the future ETc.ThemodelfindingsindicatedthatKafrAshShaykhwillachievethefirstrank for recording high increased by 11.31 then Ad Daqahliyahwith an increased by 1.38 %. On the other hand, the expected resultsstatedthatAshSharqiyahregionwoulddecreaseby15.09%comparedto the historical dataset. These created DNN models produced sa-tisfactory outputs with high accuracy for the three regions. Therefore,these models will help the water managers-planners and decision-makers for long term water sustainability. This study is essential as animportantstepinsupportingagriculturalwatermanagementstrategies,for crop-water modeling. Our recommendations can be used on largescale in all Nile Delta governorates as rapid, robust and reliabletechnique for modeling ETcusing limited meteorological data andsimple method. In the future, the proposed model can be applied toother economic crops, such as rice and maize, for modeling ETctoachieve sustainable agricultural water management.Author contributionsAhmed Elbeltagi and Jinsong Deng had the original idea for thestudy and all coauthors conceived and designed the study.
