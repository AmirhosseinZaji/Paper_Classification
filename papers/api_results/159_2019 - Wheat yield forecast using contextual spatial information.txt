Class: wheat_yield_forecasting

Summary: The research paper focuses on wheat yield forecasting using contextual spatial information. The study utilizes machine learning approaches, specifically bootstrapped regression trees (BRT) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), to forecast wheat yield at a fine resolution of 5m. The paper explores the use of publicly available data, such as Sentinel imagery and farm-owned data, to improve yield forecasting accuracy. Results indicate that CNN outperformed BRT, especially with higher resolution data. The study highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in leveraging digitized data for within-paddock yield variability predictions, emphasizing the importance of incorporating contextual information for improved forecasting accuracy.
