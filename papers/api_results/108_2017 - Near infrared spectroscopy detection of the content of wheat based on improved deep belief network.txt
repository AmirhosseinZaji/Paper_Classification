Class: wheat_content_estimation

Summary: The main goal of the research paper is to propose a method for predicting the content of wheat components (moisture, protein, and ash) using near infrared spectroscopy based on an improved deep belief network. The paper utilizes wavelet transform for preprocessing the near infrared spectroscopy data of wheat and establishes a quantitative analysis model for the wheat components. By combining deep belief network with the random hidden algorithm, the network model is enhanced for improved accuracy and stability in predicting the content of wheat components. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved deep belief network model in predicting wheat content, showing significant improvements over traditional methods.
