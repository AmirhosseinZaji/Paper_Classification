Class: wheat_spike_detection_and_counting

Summary: The research paper proposes a computationally efficient system called DeepCount for automatically identifying and counting the number of wheat spikes in digital images taken under natural field conditions. The method utilizes simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) for superpixel segmentation and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for semantic segmentation of wheat spikes. The DeepCount model outperforms a handcrafted edge detection method in accurately quantifying wheat spikes, showcasing high robustness across different growth stages, canopy complexities, and environmental conditions. The study demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of the DeepCount approach for high-throughput wheat spike counting, paving the way for portable and smartphone-assisted systems in wheat phenotyping.
