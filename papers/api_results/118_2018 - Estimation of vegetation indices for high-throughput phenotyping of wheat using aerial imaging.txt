Summary: The research paper focuses on estimating vegetation indices for high-throughput phenotyping of wheat using aerial imaging. The study presents a novel method for model-based estimation of vegetation indices (VI) using RGB color images. Deep neural networks are employed to learn the spatio-spectral relationship between RGB images of vegetation and the corresponding VI computed from multispectral images. The results demonstrate that VI can be accurately estimated using deep neural networks from RGB images, indicating the feasibility of low-cost VI measurement with standard RGB cameras. The study validates the approach for estimating VI and highlights the importance of spatial, spectral, and temporal information in VI estimation for wheat breeding trials.
