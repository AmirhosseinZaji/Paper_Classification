Summary: The research paper focuses on estimating wheat ear density using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to high-resolution RGB images. The study compares two approaches, Faster-RCNN and TasselNet, for ear density estimation. The Faster-RCNN model demonstrated robustness and high performance, with an emphasis on the optimal spatial resolution for accurate detection. The study also evaluates the heritability of ear density estimates from RGB images and their agreement with ground measurements. The results show promising outcomes for high-throughput phenotyping of wheat crops using deep learning techniques.
