Class: wheat_content_estimation

Summary: The research paper focuses on developing a computational intelligent image processing algorithm for on-site inference of nitrogen content in wheat plants. The main goal is to estimate nutrient content in wheat plants non-destructively based on plant images captured in the field under varying lighting conditions. The paper proposes a method using deep learning multilayer perceptron and genetic algorithm-based global optimization for color normalization and nitrogen estimation. The study aims to enhance nitrogen estimation results compared to traditional methods and improve precision farming practices by accurately estimating nitrogen status in wheat plants.
