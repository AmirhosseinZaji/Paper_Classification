Class: wheat_spike_detection_and_counting

Summary: The research paper focuses on the detection and analysis of wheat spikes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for yield estimation. The study aims to accurately detect, count, and analyze wheat spikes in field images to assess spike density and classification probability for different wheat varieties under various fertilizer treatments. The proposed robust R-CNN model achieves high accuracy ranging from 88 to 94% across different sets of test images. The paper introduces the SPIKE dataset, which contains annotated images used for training the CNN models. The study demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques in accurately quantifying spike production in wheat fields, benefiting plant breeders in selecting high-yielding varieties.
