Class: wheat_spike_detection_and_counting

Summary: The research paper introduces TasselNetv2, a model designed for counting wheat spikes accurately and automatically in the field using computer vision technologies. The paper addresses the limitations of existing models by proposing a contextual extension to TasselNet, which significantly improves counting performance by incorporating visual context into the local patches. TasselNetv2 achieves state-of-the-art counting accuracy on a large-scale wheat spikes counting dataset and demonstrates efficiency by processing images faster than its predecessor. The model's effectiveness is further validated on other datasets, showcasing its potential for real-time applications in plant counting.
