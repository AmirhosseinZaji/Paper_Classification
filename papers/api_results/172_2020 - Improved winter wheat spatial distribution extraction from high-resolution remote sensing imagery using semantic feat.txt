Class: wheat_spatial_distribution_extraction

Summary: The research paper focuses on improving the accuracy of winter wheat spatial distribution extraction from remote sensing imagery using a post-processing convolutional neural network (PP-CNN) method. The study utilizes statistical analysis to refine convolutional neural network (CNN) classification results, especially at the edge areas of winter wheat fields. By incorporating prior knowledge about the similarity in color and texture between inner and edge pixels of winter wheat, the proposed PP-CNN method effectively enhances the classification accuracy, particularly in edge areas. The study demonstrates the advantages of the PP-CNN approach over other methods through comparative experiments, showing superior accuracy, precision, and recall rates.
