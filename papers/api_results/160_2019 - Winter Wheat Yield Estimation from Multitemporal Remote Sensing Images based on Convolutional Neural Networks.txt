Summary: The research paper focuses on winter wheat yield estimation using multi-temporal remote sensing images and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The study aims to utilize deep learning techniques, specifically CNN, to extract relevant information from remote sensing images for accurate yield estimation in North China. The paper introduces methods like histogram dimensionality reduction and time series fusion to preprocess the data for CNN input. The results show a high correlation between the estimated winter wheat yield and statistical data, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.82 and RMSE of 724.72 kgÂ·hm-2. The study demonstrates the potential of CNN in extracting features for crop yield estimation and provides insights for large-scale crop yield estimation using remote sensing technology.
