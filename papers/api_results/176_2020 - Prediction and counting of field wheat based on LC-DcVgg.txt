Class: wheat_spike_detection_and_counting

Summary: The research paper focuses on the prediction and counting of field wheat spikes per unit area using a novel approach that combines deep learning algorithms with a direct connection structure to improve the counting accuracy. The proposed model, LC-DcVggnet, utilizes point label-based CNN neural network for wheat spike counting, overcoming challenges such as occlusion and complex field environments. The model achieves an MAE of 11.857, an accuracy rate of 90.4%, and RMSE of 16.985, demonstrating effective recognition of wheat spikes, especially in dense and overlapping scenarios. The study emphasizes the importance of accurate wheat spike counting for yield prediction and agricultural automation.
