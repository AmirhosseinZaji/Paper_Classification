Class: wheat_content_estimation

Summary: The research paper focuses on using deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for land cover and crop type classification using multitemporal multisource satellite imagery. The study aims to classify major crops such as wheat, maize, sunflower, soybeans, and sugar beet with high accuracy. The proposed architecture with an ensemble of CNNs outperforms traditional methods like multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and random forests, achieving accuracies exceeding 85% for all major crops, including wheat. The paper discusses the challenges of dealing with missing data, cloud and shadow contamination, and the benefits of using CNNs for better discrimination of crop types.
