Class: wheat_yield_estimation

Summary: The research paper focuses on estimating wheat yields in the Indian Wheat Belt using explainable deep learning models. The study explores the application of deep neural networks to multivariate time series data of vegetation and meteorological variables to predict wheat yield. The models outperformed traditional regression and random forest models and provided insights into the factors influencing yield variability. The research also introduces regression activation maps (RAMs) to visualize and interpret how the models achieve their results, highlighting the importance of factors such as temperature, light conditions, and growing season length in determining wheat yields. The methodology aims to enhance the application of deep learning models in agriculture for yield estimation and prediction.
