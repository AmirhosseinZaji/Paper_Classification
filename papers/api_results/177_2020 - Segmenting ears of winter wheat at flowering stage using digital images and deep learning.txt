Summary: The research paper focuses on segmenting ears of winter wheat from canopy images captured at the flowering stage using a two-stage segmentation method based on digital images and deep learning techniques. The coarse segmentation stage involves a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to classify superpixels, while the fine segmentation stage utilizes a fully convolutional network (FCN) for pixel-wise semantic segmentation. The proposed method outperforms other compared methods in accurately segmenting wheat ears. The study also discusses the impact of factors like winter wheat cultivar change and lack of descriptive information on the segmentation performance. Additionally, the study explores the generalization ability of the method on different image datasets, including UAV-based canopy images.
