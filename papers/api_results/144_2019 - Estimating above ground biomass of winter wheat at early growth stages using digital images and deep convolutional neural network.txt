Summary: The research paper proposes an easy-to-use method for estimating above ground biomass (AGB) of winter wheat at early growth stages using digital images captured under field conditions and a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). The DCNN was trained to learn the relationship between canopy images and corresponding AGB values. Results showed strong correlations between actual AGB measurements and those estimated by the DCNN, indicating its potential as an efficient and robust tool for AGB estimation. The study also evaluated factors influencing the accuracy of the DCNN, such as color information, data augmentation, learning rate, and mini-batch size. Additionally, the paper compared the performance of the DCNN with conventional methods for AGB estimation, showing the superiority of the DCNN in terms of accuracy and robustness.
