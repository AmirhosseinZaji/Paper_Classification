Summary: The research paper focuses on developing an accurate wheat production forecasting model for Pakistan using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The study aims to address the increasing wheat consumption and the potential threats to the country's economy by providing a reliable forecasting model. The paper introduces a data pre-processing smoothing mechanism in conjunction with the LSTM model to enhance prediction accuracy. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing models, indicating a gradual increase in wheat production over the next ten years but a continued decline in the production to consumption ratio, posing economic challenges. The study suggests using the proposed framework for sustainable wheat production and potentially for other crops as well.
