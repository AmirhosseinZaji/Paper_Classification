Summary: The research paper introduces DeepSpectra, an end-to-end deep learning approach for quantitative spectral analysis without the need for data preprocessing. DeepSpectra, incorporating an Inception module, outperforms other CNN models on raw spectra analysis for corn, tablet, wheat, and soil datasets. The study demonstrates that DeepSpectra provides improved results compared to conventional linear and nonlinear calibration approaches in most scenarios. The model repeatability and accuracy are shown to improve with increased sample sizes, particularly showcasing better performance on datasets with larger sample sizes like soil samples. The paper emphasizes the importance of understanding the minimum and recommended sample size requirements for deep learning-based spectral analysis for improved model accuracy and repeatability.
